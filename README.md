### Hi there 👋
I am a 17 year old, enthusiastic IT and computer science student living in the UK from 🇭🇺.
I was a Minecraft Server developer for four years. Now, I am working with PHP.

### My background 💫
I started coding back in 2015, practice with Visual Studio, on small projects/games, as I was interested
in how computer programs/games were made. I also made my own blog, and I experimented
with some HTML. After all of this, one of my favourite games, Minecraft, had Servers -- which inspired me
to work on my own! And now, I am a full-stack developer working on my own PHP website.
